# NestJS GraphQL Qdrant Postgres Server

This project serves as a robust backend foundation for [briefly describe your application, e.g., an e-commerce platform, a content management system, etc.]. It leverages the power of NestJS, GraphQL, Qdrant, and Postgres to provide a scalable and efficient data management solution.

## Project Overview

This project showcases the integration of several cutting-edge technologies to build a high-performance backend server:

* **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
* **GraphQL:** A powerful query language and runtime for APIs, enabling clients to request exactly what they need.
* **Qdrant:** A vector similarity search engine, ideal for finding related items based on their vector representations.
* **Postgres:** A reliable and feature-rich relational database for storing structured data.

## Technologies Used

* **Language:** TypeScript
* **Framework:** NestJS
* **API:** GraphQL
* **Databases:** Postgres, Qdrant
* **Other:** Docker, [mention any other relevant technologies, e.g., TypeORM if used]

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/IrePro78/NestJS_GraphQL_Qdrant_Postgres_Server.git](https://github.com/IrePro78/NestJS_GraphQL_Qdrant_Postgres_Server.git)

 2. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
    cd NestJS_GraphQL_Qdrant_Postgres_Server
  ```
  3. Install dependencies:
```bash
  npm install
```
  4. Configure Postgres database:
   Create a database named [your database name].
   Update the database connection details in the [.env or configuration file].
  5. Configure Qdrant:
    Run Qdrant locally or use a cloud-based instance.
    Update the Qdrant connection details in the [.env or configuration file].
  6. Start the server:
     ```bash
     npm run start:dev
     ```
Usage
The server will be running on port [port number]. You can access the GraphiQL interface at [GraphQL endpoint URL] to interact with the API.
